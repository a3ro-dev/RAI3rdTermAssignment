# Mathematical Series and Numbers Generator

This project contains a Python script that generates and calculates different mathematical series and numbers. It includes methods for generating Pascal's triangle, prime numbers, subsets of a set, and Armstrong numbers, converting integers to Roman numerals and different number systems, and calculating the sum of factorial and natural logarithm series and class averages.

## Features

1. **Generate Pascal Triangle**: Generates a Pascal's triangle of a given size.
2. **Generate Prime Numbers**: Generates a list of prime numbers up to a given number.
3. **Generate Subsets**: Generates all possible subsets of a set of a given size.
4. **Generate Roman Numbers**: Converts a given integer to a Roman numeral.
5. **Calculate Factorial Series**: Calculates the sum of the factorial series up to a given number.
6. **Generate Armstrong Numbers**: Generates a list of Armstrong numbers between 1 and 500.
7. **Convert Number**: Converts a given integer to its octal, hexadecimal, and binary representations.
8. **Calculate Natural Logarithm Series**: Calculates the sum of the natural logarithm series up to a given number.
9. **Calculate Class Average**: Calculates the average of a given list of grades.

## Usage

Run the `main.py` script in a Python environment. The script will prompt you to choose a feature and enter the necessary inputs.

```bash
python main.py
